#+title: tcp-async-tokio
#+author: John Carter Gonzalez

* Implement an asynchronous runtime with Tokio
+ The Why?
  - develop a deeper understanding of TCP, and varying Protocols
  - Redis is a very popular protocol, with obvious benefits of getting familar with it
+ The How?
  - studying [[https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/][tokios]] runtime documentation
  - studying [[https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/][redis']] protocol documentation

Note: To run this project
1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.54)` installed locally
2. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be
   slow the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
